[![HA Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Home%20Assistant-2026.3.2%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

Local Bluetooth (BLE) support for Tuya devices in Home Assistant. Device credentials are fetched once from the Tuya cloud; after that all communication happens directly over Bluetooth — no cloud dependency at runtime.

**IoT class:** Local Push — the device pushes state changes to HA over BLE.

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2026.3.2 or newer
- HACS 2.0.5 or newer
- A Bluetooth adapter accessible to your HA host (built-in or USB)
- The built-in **Tuya** integration already configured in HA (provides cloud credential resolution)
- A **Tuya IoT Platform** project with access to your devices ([developer.tuya.com](https://developer.tuya.com))

---

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Click **⋮ → Custom repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/briis/ha_tuya_ble` with category **Integration**.
4. Search for **Tuya BLE** and click **Download**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_component/tuya_ble` folder into your `<config>/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Configuration

The integration is configured via the UI (Config Flow). No YAML is needed.

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Tuya BLE**.
3. Choose a setup method:
   - **Auto-discover via Bluetooth** — HA scans for nearby devices and fetches credentials from Tuya cloud (requires a Tuya IoT Platform account).
   - **Enter device credentials manually** — supply credentials directly, no cloud account needed during setup.

---

### Option A — Auto-discover via Bluetooth

1. Choose **Auto-discover via Bluetooth**.
2. Enter your Tuya IoT Platform credentials (Access ID, Access Secret, account, region).
3. HA presents all nearby Tuya BLE devices for selection.
4. Select your device and complete setup.

#### Getting Tuya IoT Platform credentials

1. Log in at [developer.tuya.com](https://developer.tuya.com) and create a Cloud project.
2. Link your devices by scanning the QR code in the Tuya Smart / Smart Life app under **Profile → Tap to Scan**.
3. Copy the **Access ID** and **Access Secret** from your project's **Overview** tab.

The integration calls the Tuya cloud API during initial setup (and when re-fetching credentials) but does **not** require cloud connectivity for day-to-day operation.

---

### Option B — Manual device entry (using tinytuya)

If you already have the device credentials — for example exported from tinytuya — you can add devices without going through the cloud login step.

#### 1. Export credentials with tinytuya

[tinytuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya) is a Python library that can scan your local network and export device credentials (including BLE devices registered in your Tuya account).

```bash
pip install tinytuya
python -m tinytuya wizard
```

The wizard will ask for your Tuya IoT Platform credentials once, then write a `devices.json` file to the current directory. Each entry looks like this:

```json
{
    "name": "Curtain 1",
    "id": "bf4700saaq7lxjqm",
    "key": "cgxnvGyVt3HHs|.D",
    "mac": "DC:23:53:1A:92:92",
    "uuid": "2ecf823f6c2842ab",
    "category": "cl",
    "product_name": "Cellular",
    "product_id": "dy4dh1q0",
    "model": "AM24B-0.6/34-ES-IB"
}
```

#### 2. Add the device in Home Assistant

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Tuya BLE**.
2. Choose **Enter device credentials manually**.
3. Fill in the form using the values from `devices.json`:

| Form field | JSON field | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **MAC address** | `mac` | `DC:23:53:1A:92:92` |
| **Device name** | `name` | `Curtain 1` |
| **Device UUID** | `uuid` | `2ecf823f6c2842ab` |
| **Local key** | `key` | `cgxnvGyVt3HHs|.D` |
| **Device ID** | `id` | `bf4700saaq7lxjqm` |
| **Category code** | `category` | `cl` |
| **Product ID** | `product_id` | `dy4dh1q0` |
| **Product name** *(optional)* | `product_name` | `Cellular` |
| **Model** *(optional)* | `model` | `AM24B-0.6/34-ES-IB` |

4. Click **Submit**. The device is added immediately — no cloud round-trip needed.

> **Note:** The local key can rotate when you reset a device or re-pair it in the app. If a manually-added device stops responding, open its **Configure** dialog and update the **Local key** field.

#### Updating credentials later

Open the entry in **Settings → Devices & Services**, click **Configure**, and the manual credential form will be shown pre-filled with current values so you can update only what changed.

## How it works

1. **Discovery:** Home Assistant's Bluetooth integration passively scans for BLE advertisements containing the Tuya service UUID (`0000a201-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`).
2. **Credential lookup:** When a matching device is found, the integration queries the Tuya cloud API to retrieve the device's local encryption key.
3. **Local connection:** All subsequent communication uses an encrypted BLE connection directly to the device — no cloud involved.
4. **State updates:** The device pushes datapoint (DP) updates over BLE; HA entities update immediately.

## Fingerbot

Fingerbot devices (physical button pushers) expose several modes via the **Select** entity:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| Switch mode | Acts like a toggle switch (push once to activate, push again to release) |
| Program mode | Runs a programmable sequence of positions and delays |

In **Program mode**, the **Text** entity accepts a sequence string in the format:

```
<position>[/<delay_ms>][;<position>[/<delay_ms>]]...
```

Example: `100/500;0` — go to position 100, wait 500 ms, return to position 0.

---

## Thermostatic Radiator Valve (TRV)

The TRV exposes a **Climate** entity with heating mode. Additional configuration switches include:

- **Window detection** — automatically reduces heating when a window is detected open
- **Antifreeze** — maintains a minimum temperature to prevent pipe freeze
- **Child lock** — disables physical controls on the device
- **Water scale protection** — periodic valve exercise to prevent limescale seizure
- **Programming mode / Programming switch** — enables and activates the device's built-in schedule

---

## Smart Lock T83

The Smart Lock T83 (`YSG_T83_NO_NFC`, product `lmfdx8in`) is controlled entirely over Bluetooth, without the Tuya cloud or a gateway:

- **Lock** sends `manual_lock` (DP 46).
- **Unlock** registers a random, single-use 8 digit code for member slot 7 through `remote_no_pd_setkey` (DP 60), valid for ±5 minutes, and immediately unlocks with it through `remote_no_dp_key` (DP 61).
- The lock state follows `lock_motor_state` (DP 47).

If the lock rejects a command, the reason it reports (for example *wrong code* or *outside of the validity period*) is shown as an error in Home Assistant. Enable debug logging for `custom_components.tuya_ble` to see the raw datapoints exchanged with the lock.

### Managing passwords

The lock entity offers these actions (**Developer tools → Actions**), which also work in automations and scripts:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tuya_ble.add_password` | Adds a permanent password (6–10 digits), optionally limited to a period or a number of uses. Returns the slot (`hardware_id`) the lock stored it in. |
| `tuya_ble.delete_password` | Deletes a password by its slot. |
| `tuya_ble.add_temporary_password` | Adds a password that only works between `start` and `end`. Returns its slot. |
| `tuya_ble.delete_temporary_password` | Deletes a temporary password by its slot. |
| `tuya_ble.get_unlock_methods` | Lists the passwords and fingerprints stored in the lock. |

Example:

```yaml
action: tuya_ble.add_temporary_password
target:
  entity_id: lock.smart_lock_t83_4f0968
data:
  code: "246810"
  start: "2026-09-20 10:00:00"
  end: "2026-09-20 18:00:00"
```

Passwords added from Home Assistant are stored only in the lock. The Tuya app does not know about them and may remove them when it synchronises the lock.

### Auto lock (experimental)

The lock relocks itself a few seconds after every unlock, which also ends a remote unlock. Two standard Tuya lock datapoints control that, and neither is in the cloud schema of this lock:

| Entity | Datapoint |
|---|---|
| Auto lock | 33 (auto_locking) |
| Auto lock delay | 36 (auto_locking_timer) |

The radio module passes datapoint writes on to the lock controller without checking them against the cloud schema, so these two entities exist to find out whether the controller implements them. If it ignores them, nothing changes and the entities keep their default values. A reply on datapoint 33 or 36 in the debug log tells the difference.
