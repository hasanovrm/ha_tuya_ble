## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Smart Lock T83** (`ms` / `lmfdx8in`, model `YSG_T83_NO_NFC`):
  - Lock entity with fully local control. Locking uses `manual_lock` (DP 46); unlocking registers a random single-use code through `remote_no_pd_setkey` (DP 60) and immediately unlocks with it through `remote_no_dp_key` (DP 61), so no key from the Tuya cloud is needed. State comes from `lock_motor_state` (DP 47), and error replies from the lock (wrong code, outside validity period, double locked, …) are reported back to Home Assistant.
  - Sensors for alarm (DP 21), battery (DP 8) and the slot used for the last unlock by fingerprint (DP 12), password (DP 13) and Bluetooth (DP 19); dynamic password (DP 14), temporary password (DP 55) and remote unlock (DP 62) sensors are disabled by default.
  - Unlock and hold button entity, which runs the same sequence as the action of the same name.
  - Action tuya_ble.unlock_and_hold: switches auto locking off and unlocks, checking the lock replies after each step and retrying, for safety automations.
  - Experimental switch for auto locking (DP 33) and number for the auto locking delay (DP 36). Both datapoints are missing from the cloud schema of this lock and are exposed to find out whether the lock controller implements them.
  - Selects for beep volume (DP 31) and lock language (DP 28), binary sensor for the double lock state (DP 32). The language options follow the order the lock firmware actually uses, which differs from the labels in the Tuya cloud schema.
  - Actions to add and delete permanent and temporary passwords and to list the passwords and fingerprints stored in the lock: `tuya_ble.add_password`, `tuya_ble.delete_password`, `tuya_ble.add_temporary_password`, `tuya_ble.delete_temporary_password` and `tuya_ble.get_unlock_methods`.
- State translations for the lock alarm, beep volume and language entities.

## [2.1.3] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **"Unknown error occurred" when configuring an unavailable device** — `_try_login` used a bare `next()` with no default, causing a `StopIteration` → `RuntimeError` when the stored country was a raw country code (`"DK"`) rather than a name (`"Denmark"`). Now returns an `invalid_auth` error gracefully instead of crashing.
- **Options flow silently re-displayed the login form** when the device's integration entry was not loaded (BLE device unavailable during setup retry). Now shows an explicit *"integration not loaded — restart Home Assistant"* error.
- **Password pre-fill** removed from the options flow cloud login form (was already fixed in the config flow in 2.1.2; now consistent in both places).

### Added

- **"Update method" selector in Configure dialog for manual entries** — clicking *Configure* on a manually-added device now shows a choice between *Edit credentials manually* (existing behaviour, pre-filled form) and *Fetch updated credentials from Tuya cloud* (runs the cloud login flow without needing to delete and re-add the device).

---

## [2.1.2] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Manual entry form: added helper text for the optional *Product name* and *Model* fields in all three languages, matching the descriptions already present on the required fields.
- Cloud login form: password field no longer pre-fills from the Tuya integration credential cache, preventing confusing dots from appearing in an apparently empty field.

---

## [2.1.1] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Manual device entry** — devices can now be added without a Tuya cloud login by entering credentials directly in the config flow. When you choose *"Enter device credentials manually"* you are prompted for the MAC address, UUID, local key, device ID, category code, product ID, and optionally product name and model. All of these fields are present in a standard [tinytuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya) `devices.json` export.
- **Options flow for manual devices** — opening *Configure* on a manually-added entry now shows a pre-filled credential edit form instead of the cloud login form, making it easy to update the local key if it rotates.
- **Danish translation** (`da.json`) — full translation of all config flow steps, error messages, and entity strings.
- **German translation** (`de.json`) — full translation of all config flow steps, error messages, and entity strings.
- **README: manual entry guide** — new *Option B* section explains how to export credentials with `tinytuya wizard` and maps every JSON field to the corresponding form field.

### Changed

- The initial config flow user step now presents a setup method selector (*Auto-discover via Bluetooth* vs *Enter device credentials manually*) instead of going straight to the cloud login form.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-17

First public release of this fork, based on [airy10/ha_tuya_ble](https://github.com/airy10/ha_tuya_ble) which itself originates from [PlusPlus-ua/ha_tuya_ble](https://github.com/PlusPlus-ua/ha_tuya_ble).

### Added

- **Cover platform** — support for curtain motors and blinds (`cl`, `clkg`, `jdcljqr` categories), including open/close/stop and explicit position control.
- **All other platforms carried over** from the upstream integration: binary sensor, button, climate (TRV), light (strip lights), lock, number, select, sensor, switch, and text (Fingerbot program sequences).
- **Signal strength sensor** (disabled by default) on every device.
- **`tuya_ble/` low-level library** — BLE protocol implementation with AES encryption, chunked packet reassembly, and fire-and-forget task tracking via a `_background_tasks` set.
- **Full lint pass** — brought `scripts/lint` (ruff format + ruff check) from ~100 errors to zero; suppressions documented in `.ruff.toml`.

### Fixed

- BLE device discovery now checks both `service_data` and `service_uuids` advertisement fields, fixing devices that advertise the Tuya service UUID in the latter.
- `EnumTypeData.from_json` accepts a pre-parsed `dict` in addition to a raw JSON string, fixing a crash when setting up covers whose DP spec was already decoded by the cloud client.
- `get_category_mapping` returns an empty tuple instead of `None` when no mapping is found, preventing a `TypeError` during cover entity setup.
- Protocol error messages downgraded from `ERROR` to `WARNING` (with `exc_info=True`) to avoid flooding the HA error log during normal BLE reconnection churn.
- Corrected log message typos: *"Unexpcted packet"* → *"Unexpected packet"* (×2).
